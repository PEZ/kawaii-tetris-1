# Kawaii Tetris - TODO Roadmap üó∫Ô∏èüíñ

This document outlines the development plan for Kawaii Tetris. Tasks are grouped into milestones, with the current milestone being the most detailed. We aim to follow functional and data-oriented principles throughout.

---

## üéØ Milestone 1: Core Mechanics MVP (In Progress)

**Goal:** Get the absolute basic Tetris mechanics working. Focus on data structures and pure(r) functions for game logic, rendered simply using p5.js. Ugly is okay at this stage!

**Guiding Principles:**
*   Represent game state as immutable data structures where practical.
*   Separate game logic (state transformations) from rendering (drawing the state).
*   Keep functions small and focused.

**Tasks:**

*   **[X] Project Setup:**
    *   `[X]` Basic HTML file (`index.html`) to host the p5.js sketch.
    *   `[X]` Basic p5.js sketch file (`sketch.js`).
    *   `[X]` Include p5.js library.
    *   `[X]` Link `sketch.js` in `index.html`.
*   **[X] Game State Definition:**
    *   `[X]` Define the core `gameState` data structure (e.g., a JavaScript object).
    *   `[X]` Include `board` (e.g., a 2D array representing the grid).
    *   `[X]` Include `currentPiece` structure (object with `type`, `x`, `y`, `rotation` properties).
    *   `[X]` Define initial state function/value.
*   **[X] Board Representation & Rendering:**
    *   `[X]` Define board dimensions (width, height in grid units).
    *   `[X]` Implement a function `drawBoard(boardData)` that renders the grid.
    *   `[X]` Use simple rectangles (via `drawBlock`) for filled cells for now.
*   **[ ] Tetromino Definitions:**
    *   `[ ]` **Verify/Correct the shapes of all 7 tetrominoes and all rotations.** Store this as data in `TETROMINOES`. <- **Crucial Next Step**
    *   `[ ]` Implement a function `getRandomPieceType()` that returns a random key ('I', 'L', etc.) from `TETROMINOES`. <- **Next**
*   **[ ] Spawning Pieces:**
    *   `[ ]` Implement a function `spawnPiece(gameState)`:
        *   `[ ]` Uses `getRandomPieceType()` to get the next piece type.
        *   `[ ]` Creates a new piece object (with type, initial rotation, starting x/y).
        *   `[ ]` Returns a *new* game state with the `currentPiece` updated.
    *   `[ ]` Update `getInitialState()` to call `spawnPiece` to set the first `currentPiece`, instead of using the hardcoded `testPiece`.
*   **[ ] Basic Piece Movement (User Input):**
    *   `[ ]` Handle keyboard input (`LEFT_ARROW`, `RIGHT_ARROW`, `DOWN_ARROW`) in p5.js `keyPressed()`.
    *   `[ ]` Implement pure functions `moveLeft(gameState)`, `moveRight(gameState)`, `moveDown(gameState)` that return a *new* game state if the move is valid.
    *   `[ ]` Update `gameState` in `keyPressed()` based on the results of these movement functions.
*   **[ ] Gravity (Automatic Downward Movement):**
    *   `[ ]` Use p5.js `draw()` loop timing (e.g., frame count or `millis()`) to trigger automatic downward movement.
    *   `[ ]` Apply the `moveDown(gameState)` logic periodically.
*   **[ ] Basic Collision Detection (Floor & Walls):**
    *   `[ ]` Implement a helper function `isPositionValid(piece, boardData)` that checks if a piece's position is within bounds and not overlapping settled blocks on the board.
    *   `[ ]` Enhance movement functions (`moveLeft`, `moveRight`, `moveDown`) to use `isPositionValid` before returning the new state.
*   **[X] Rendering the Current Piece:**
    *   `[X]` Implement a function `drawPiece(pieceData)` that renders the `currentPiece`.
    *   `[X]` Call `drawPiece` in the main `draw()` loop.
*   **[X] Basic Game Loop Integration:**
    *   `[X]` Ensure `setup()` initializes the game state.
    *   `[X]` Ensure `draw()` clears the background, draws the board, and draws the current piece.
*   **[X] Deployment Setup (GitHub Actions & Pages):**
    *   `[X]` Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file.
    *   `[X]` Configure the workflow to trigger on push to the `master` branch using `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`.
    *   `[X]` Configure the artifact upload path (`.`).
    *   `[X]` Configure GitHub Pages settings in the repository (Source: Deploy from branch `gh-pages`). <- *Note: This setting might now need to point to the `gh-pages` branch if using this action.*
    *   `[X]` Verified deployment working.

##  milestone 2: Gameplay Polish & Basic Kawaii üå∏

**Goal:** Implement core gameplay features like rotation, locking, line clearing, and scoring. Start introducing the "kawaii" look and feel.

**Tasks:**

*   `[ ]` Piece Rotation Logic (Clockwise/Counter-Clockwise).
    *   `[ ]` Implement rotation transformation logic (pure function on piece data).
    *   `[ ]` Handle input for rotation.
    *   `[ ]` Add collision detection for rotation (walls, floor, other pieces).
*   `[ ]` Piece Locking Mechanism.
    *   `[ ]` Detect when a piece cannot move down further (collides with floor or settled pieces).
    *   `[ ]` Merge the `currentPiece` blocks into the main `board` data structure.
    *   `[ ]` Trigger spawning of a new piece.
*   `[ ]` Line Clearing Logic.
    *   `[ ]` Check for completed lines after a piece locks.
    *   `[ ]` Implement function to remove completed lines and shift rows above down. (Focus on data transformation!).
*   `[ ]` Basic Scoring System.
    *   `[ ]` Add `score` to `gameState`.
    *   `[ ]` Update score based on lines cleared.
    *   `[ ]` Display score on screen.
*   `[ ]` "Next Piece" Preview.
    *   `[ ]` Add `nextPiece` to `gameState`.
    *   `[ ]` Implement logic to generate and store the next piece.
    *   `[ ]` Render the next piece in a designated area.
*   `[ ]` Game Over Condition.
    *   `[ ]` Detect when a new piece spawns overlapping existing blocks (game over).
    *   `[ ]` Add `isGameOver` flag to `gameState`.
    *   `[ ]` Stop game loop / display game over message.
*   `[ ]` **Basic Kawaii Assets:**
    *   `[ ]` Design or find simple, cute block sprites/colors.
    *   `[ ]` Update rendering functions to use these basic assets instead of plain rectangles.
