*   Adorable, kawaii-themed graphics and style.
*   Runs smoothly on desktop and mobile browsers.
*   Built with the creative coding library [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

## ðŸ’» Technology & Philosophy

Kawaii Tetris is built using **[p5.js](https://p5js.org/)**, leveraging its power for graphics and interaction in the browser.

However, the development approach taken here is intentionally **data-oriented** and heavily influenced by **functional programming** principles. We believe this leads to more predictable, testable, and maintainable code.

At every step of the development process, the guiding question has been:

> *"What would Rich Hickey do?"*

The team is deeply inspired by the ideas articulated within the Clojure community regarding state management, immutability, and functional composition. Rafael Dittwald's insightful talk, "[Solving Problems the Clojure Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK1DazRK_a0)", has been a significant influence and watched multiple times throughout development.

While p5.js often lends itself to more imperative or object-oriented patterns, this project consciously attempts to manage game state through data transformations and pure(r) functions wherever practical within the JavaScript environment.
