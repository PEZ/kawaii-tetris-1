# Kawaii Tetris üß∏üß±‚ú®

‚û°Ô∏è **[Play Kawaii Tetris Live!](https://pez.github.io/kawaii-tetris-1/)** ‚¨ÖÔ∏è

Welcome to **Kawaii Tetris** - the classic block-stacking puzzle game you know and love, but infused with a *super cute* aesthetic!

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

This project is being developed collaboratively using the following process:

1.  **AI Assistant (Gemini 1.5 Pro):** Hosted via the Google AI Studio UI, the assistant generates code, updates documentation (`README.md`, `TODO.md`), and helps drive the implementation based on high-level requests and the roadmap.
2.  **Human Developer (User):** Interacts with the AI via the AI Studio UI, provides feedback, identifies issues, and manages the local project files. This involves downloading the complete code files generated by the AI, replacing local versions, committing changes to Git, and pushing to GitHub for deployment.
3.  **Friction Point:** A recurring issue is the AI assistant sometimes providing truncated/incomplete code files, requiring correction and iteration. Despite this friction, the general process enables rapid prototyping and development.
4.  **Debugging:** When issues arise (like rendering failures or logic errors), the process involves analyzing browser console logs provided by the user, simplifying specific code sections to isolate the problem, adding targeted `console.log` statements, and iterating based on the observed behavior.

## üß≠ Roadmap

The overall plan is outlined in the **[TODO Roadmap](TODO.md)**. The AI assistant updates this file to track progress.

## üß™ Project Context

This project is an experiment in **"Vibe Coding"** with **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro**. It draws heavy inspiration from **"Cute Tetris"**, originally vibe coded by **Megan Ben Dor Ruthven** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maruthven/), [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/mbdr-byte/ai-code)). We're exploring how AI collaboration can facilitate development, particularly using functional and data-oriented approaches inspired by Clojure principles within a p5.js context, aiming for a "Kawaii" aesthetic twist.

## ‚ú® Features

*   Classic Tetris gameplay.
*   Adorable, kawaii-themed graphics and colors.
*   Sound Effects! ‚ú®
*   Runs smoothly on desktop browsers.
*   Built with the creative coding library [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).
*   Automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.

## üíª Technology & Philosophy

Kawaii Tetris is built using **[p5.js](https://p5js.org/)**. The development approach is intentionally **data-oriented** and heavily influenced by **functional programming** principles, guided by the question *"What would Rich Hickey do?"*. While p5.js often lends itself to imperative patterns, this project attempts state management through data transformations and pure(r) functions where practical. Rafael Dittwald's talk, "[Solving Problems the Clojure Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK1DazRK_a0)", is a significant influence.

## üöÄ Deployment

Deployed automatically via GitHub Actions ([`peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages)) on push to `master`. Live at: **[https://pez.github.io/kawaii-tetris-1/](https://pez.github.io/kawaii-tetris-1/)**
