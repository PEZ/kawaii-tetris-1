# Kawaii Tetris 🧸🧱✨

➡️ **[Play Kawaii Tetris Live!](https://pez.github.io/kawaii-tetris-1/)** ⬅️

Welcome to **Kawaii Tetris** - the classic block-stacking puzzle game you know and love, but infused with a *super cute* aesthetic!

## 🧪 Project Context

This project is an experiment in **"Vibe Coding"** with **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro**.

It draws heavy inspiration from **"Cute Tetris"**, originally vibe coded by **Megan Ben Dor Ruthven** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maruthven/), [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/mbdr-byte/ai-code)). We're exploring how AI collaboration can facilitate development, particularly using functional and data-oriented approaches inspired by Clojure principles within a p5.js context, aiming for a "Kawaii" aesthetic twist.

## ✨ Features

*   Classic Tetris gameplay (in progress).
*   Adorable, kawaii-themed graphics and style (planned).
*   Runs smoothly on desktop and mobile browsers.
*   Built with the creative coding library [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).
*   Automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.

## 💻 Technology & Philosophy

Kawaii Tetris is built using **[p5.js](https://p5js.org/)**, leveraging its power for graphics and interaction in the browser.

However, the development approach taken here is intentionally **data-oriented** and heavily influenced by **functional programming** principles. We believe this leads to more predictable, testable, and maintainable code.

At every step of the development process, the guiding question has been:

> *"What would Rich Hickey do?"*

The team is deeply inspired by the ideas articulated within the Clojure community regarding state management, immutability, and functional composition. Rafael Dittwald's insightful talk, "[Solving Problems the Clojure Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK1DazRK_a0)", has been a significant influence and watched multiple times throughout development.

While p5.js often lends itself to more imperative or object-oriented patterns, this project consciously attempts to manage game state through data transformations and pure(r) functions wherever practical within the JavaScript environment.

## 🚀 Deployment

This project is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages on every push to the `master` branch using the [`peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) GitHub Action.

The live version is available at: **[https://pez.github.io/kawaii-tetris-1/](https://pez.github.io/kawaii-tetris-1/)**
